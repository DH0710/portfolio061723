                    Hello! My name is Damien Hebert, I am a software developer currently based in Houston, Tx. Last year I completed a full stack Coding Bootcamp from Rice University that ranged from Febuary 2022 to August 2022.
                    We covered front end development technologies such as HTML, CSS, Javascript, as well as their respective frameworks like Tailwind and React.js. Once we completed our Front end development, our program went through Backend langauges and databases.
                    We completed group projects asynchronously through zoom, learning and utilizing Node.js/Express.js, as well as covering databases of MySQL and MongoDB. Through his experience I gained the skills to think critically when solving programming problems and working along with
                    a team to meet real world scenario deadlines. Some of my hobbies range from video games, anime, and watching the NBA. And as you guessed I am a Houston Rockets fan.
