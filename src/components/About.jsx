                    Hello! My name is Damien Hebert, I am a software developer currently based in Houston, Tx. In 2022, I completed a full stack Coding Bootcamp from Rice University and have been enjoying my programming journey ever since. 
                    We covered front end technologies such as HTML, CSS, Javascript, as well as other frameworks such as Tailwind and React.js. Once we completed our Front end development, our program went through Backend langauges and databases.
                    We completed group projects asynchronously through zoom. Through this experience and the months following, I've gained the skills to think critically when solving problems and working along with
                    a team to meet real world scenarios. Some of my hobbies range from video games, watching anime and the NBA.
